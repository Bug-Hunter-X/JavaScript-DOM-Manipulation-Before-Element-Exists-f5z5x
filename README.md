This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked HTML bug. The bug arises from attempting to manipulate a DOM element using JavaScript before that element has been fully parsed and added to the DOM tree by the browser.  The solution showcases a reliable method to ensure the script executes only after the DOM is ready. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the script failing silently or producing inconsistent results.
